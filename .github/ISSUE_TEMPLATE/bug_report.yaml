        If SophiApp crashes at the startup, please run this PowerShell code as `admin` [(how-to)](https://allthings.how/how-to-open-windows-powershell-as-an-admin-on-windows-11/) to find out what caused the program to crash, and attach the table, too.

        ```powershell

        $HashTable = @{
           LogName = "Application"
           Id      = "1000"
        }

        Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable $HashTable | Where-Object -FilterScript {($_.Level -eq "2") -and ($_.Message -match "SophiApp.exe")} | Select-Object -First 1 | Format-List -Property *


        $HashTable = @{
           LogName = "Application"
           Id      = "1026"
        }

        Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable $HashTable | Where-Object -FilterScript {($_.Level -eq "2") -and ($_.Message -match "SophiApp.exe")} | Select-Object -First 1 | Format-List -Property *

        ```
